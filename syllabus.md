# Course details

The syllabus information listed here is tentative. Hence, often check the website for announcements etc.

## Course Description

The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to image processing. The course demonstrates the low and mid-level vision techniques such as filtering in the spatial and frequency domain, image enhancement, edge detection, image segmentation, image compression and their applications. We will not stick with a unique text book, but it is recommended to have the book below in your library,  if you are interested in image processing literature.

## Text Book
Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods, “Digital Image Processing” (3rd Edition) Publisher: Pearson, 2008, ISBN 10: 013168728X, ISBN 13: 978-0131687288

This year I am planning to follow the below grading scheme:

## Grading Scheme
- Final (50%)
- Midterm (35%)
- Homeworks (15%)

In the previous years I preferred giving a 30% weight for homeworks and wasn't asking direct programming questions in the exams. This year I am planning to halve the weight of the homeworks and will be asking programming questions, which are directly related with the homeworks, in both the midterm and final exam. Hence I strongly recommend you to do your best on Python homeworks and grasp the usage of corresponding libraries, namely pillow numpy and matplotlib. Detailed information about homework submission will be announced separately.
