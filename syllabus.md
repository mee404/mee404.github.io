# Course details
## Course Description

The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to image processing. The course demonstrates the low and mid-level vision techniques such as filtering in the spatial and frequency domain, image enhancement, edge detection, image segmentation, image compression and their applications. We will not stick with a unique text book, but it is recommended to have the book below if you are interested in image processing literature.
